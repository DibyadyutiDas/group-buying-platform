## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

If you discover a security issue, please email dibyadyutidas0@gmail.com .

Please do **not** open public issues for security-related problems.

We will respond as soon as possible.
