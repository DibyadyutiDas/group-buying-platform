# BulkBuy: A Smart Group Buying Platform

## Overview
BulkBuy is a collaborative purchasing platform that allows users to share their planned future purchases and connect with others interested in buying the same product. By pooling orders together, users can buy in bulk and enjoy lower costs through collective purchasing power.

## How It Works
1. **User Registration & Login** – Users create an account to manage their purchases and group orders.
2. **Product Wishlist & Future Purchase Plans** – Users add products they intend to buy, along with an estimated purchase date.
3. **Group Purchase Matching** – If multiple users want the same product, they can join forces to place a bulk order.
4. **Discounts & Cost Reduction** – Buying in bulk helps users get better deals from suppliers or retailers.
5. **Community Interaction** – A discussion feature allows users to coordinate, finalize orders, and share insights.
