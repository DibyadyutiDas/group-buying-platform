## 📝 Overview
**BulkBuy** is a collaborative purchasing platform that allows users to share their planned future purchases and connect with others interested in buying the same product. By pooling orders together, users can buy in bulk and enjoy lower costs through collective purchasing power.

✔️ **Discounts & Cost Reduction** – Buying in bulk helps users get better deals from suppliers or retailers.  
✔️ **Community Interaction** – A discussion feature allows users to coordinate, finalize orders, and share insights.
